				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>New Start</h3>
						<p>
							GP missinoaries affirm to recognize the responsibility to improve from former methods of Korean mission. We declare repentance and new start.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Leadership</h3>
						<p>
							We declare do not continue the former authoritative and short-sighted leadership development, but develop biblican and Christ-like leaders through the progressing leadership training programs both before and after missionaries' installation.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Saving Souls</h3>
						<p>
							We declare we are going to focus on saving souls and reproductive workers rather than on the mega projects or purposeless investments.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Life Sacrificial Attitude</h3>
						<p>
							Korean mission was builton a self-renouncing spirit and sacrificial dedication of the gospel workers even during times of limited support. We declare to succeed the sacrificial heritage of our fore-runners while renounching selfish and indolent attitude.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Spirituality</h3>
						<p>
							Spiritual condition is an index of vitality for every missionary's life. GP missionaries should not put priority on ministry over the spiritual life. We declare to be pious and holy missionaries who find joy in intimate fellowship with God.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Church-Centered</h3>
						<p>
							Missions are a commandment given to the church. Therefore, a church without mission or mission without church-planting is being disobedient to the Lord. We declare to serve the church and to minister around the church and our effort and strategy is to establish the biblical and indigenous church.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Cooperation and Network</h3>
						<p>
							We believe all churches in the world are one body in Christ. We declare to mend partnership among the churches and mission agencies, not in competition with, but in the spirit of cooperation in order to build the Kingdom of God together.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Sharing Community</h3>
						<p>
							We declare to follow the model of the global church in their sharing spirit. We will bear each otherâ€™s burden by sharing what we have, even our financial resources.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Servant Spirit</h3>
						<p>
							We are the followers of Christ, who washed the feet of his disciples. We believe that this humble spirit is essential to save others in the mission field. We declare to live an incarnation life of servant hood shown by our Lord.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Developing Local Leadership</h3>
						<p>
							Our philosophy of ministry is to develop local leaders, so that eventually leadership should be handed over to them to continue. We declare to work together with the locals, from the pioneering stage, to set up biblical indigenous church and someday, relinquish our leadership. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Vision to raise up global mission</h3>
						<p>
							It is impossible to fulfill the task of world evangelization without churches' awakening to the need for ministry toward all people groups including 2nd and 3rd world. GP, as a mission agency which originated from Korea, strives in our efforts to raise up mission forces and leadership, not only in our mission field but among all over the world.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Giving Ultimate Glory to God</h3>
						<p>
							The ultimate purpose of our life and work is to give glory to God. We lose our purpose of existence the moment we stop glorifying God. We declare to be ruled and overwhelmed by God in all aspects of our lives until the returning of our Lord in glory
