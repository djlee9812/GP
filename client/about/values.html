				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Church-Centered</h3>
						<p>
							Missions are a commandment given to the church. Therefore, a church without mission or mission without church-planting is being disobedient to the Lord. We declare to serve the church and to minister around the church and our effort and strategy is to establish the biblical and indigenous church.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Cooperation and Network</h3>
						<p>
							We believe all churches in the world are one body in Christ. We declare to mend partnership among the churches and mission agencies, not in competition with, but in the spirit of cooperation in order to build the Kingdom of God together.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Sharing Community</h3>
						<p>
							We declare to follow the model of the global church in their sharing spirit. We will bear each otherâ€™s burden by sharing what we have, even our financial resources.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Servant Spirit</h3>
						<p>
							We are the followers of Christ, who washed the feet of his disciples. We believe that this humble spirit is essential to save others in the mission field. We declare to live an incarnation life of servant hood shown by our Lord.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Developing Local Leadership</h3>
						<p>
							Our philosophy of ministry is to develop local leaders, so that eventually leadership should be handed over to them to continue. We declare to work together with the locals, from the pioneering stage, to set up biblical indigenous church and someday, relinquish our leadership. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Giving Ultimate Glory to God</h3>
						<p>
							The ultimate purpose of our life and work is to give glory to God. We lose our purpose of existence the moment we stop glorifying God. We declare to be ruled and overwhelmed by God in all aspects of our lives until the returning of our Lord in glory
