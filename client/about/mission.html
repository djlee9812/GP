				<ul>
					<li><h3>Our calling is to give glory to God</h3>
						<p>The end of missions is to bring every tribe, every tongue, and every nation to worship and glorify God. We live a life for worship and we serve people for His glory in the power of the Spirit.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><h3>GP is a community that ushers in the end times</h3>
						<p>We go to a place where people need to know Jesus Christ in order to lead them to Jesus.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><h3>GP focuses on developing local leadership by partnership through creative mission strategy.</h3>
