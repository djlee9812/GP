				<p class="center-align margin-bottom-30 big-subheading">Holiness, Joy, Service, and Self-control are four distinct characteristic of GP missionaries.</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="creed-list">
						<p><b>Holiness</b>, without it no one will see the Lord (Heb. 12:14). Holiness is the most effective weapon for our spritual battle (Joshua 6:8). Holy lives of missionaries are more important than amazing fruit of ministries. GP missionaries will invest time with God in effort to be holy.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="creed-list">
						<p><b>Joy</b> is a precious reward of God for His people. The missionary life might be depicted as gloomy and dpressed. However, joy should be a trait of every missionary and it was the attitude of Paul, a missionary (Phil 1-4). Overflowing joy will be the secret key of the life of GP missionaries.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="creed-list">
						<p><b>Service</b> was the basic attitude of our Lord. He came to serve (Matt. 20:28). Missionaries are called to be servants for the sake of Jesus (1 Cor. 4:5). Community exists through serving each other. Every member of GP community will serve each other and serve other missionaries from other communities as well as serve those who are dying without Gospel. Service will become distinct characteristic of GP missionaries.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="creed-list">
						<p><b>Self-control</b> is a sign of maturity. It is a gift of God (Gal 5:22, 23; 1 Tim. 1:7). Self-control is not enforcement. It flows out of abundance. GP missionaries are good stewards of God who want to use given resources in self-control manner. This self-control life will teach us self-contentment keep us from lack of spiritual and physical supplies. GP missionaries are ones who know the meaning of abundance in self-control.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li><h3>Our calling is to give glory to God</h3>
						<p>The end of missions is to bring every tribe, every tongue, and every nation to worship and glorify God. We live a life for worship and we serve people for His glory in the power of the Spirit.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><h3>GP is a community that ushers in the end times</h3>
						<p>We go to a place where people need to know Jesus Christ in order to lead them to Jesus.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><h3>GP focuses on developing local leadership by partnership through creative mission strategy.</h3>
						<p>Local leaders can make missions more effective when they have their own leadership. Contextualized mission strategy leads to develop leadership, which fits into their culture.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><h3>GP aspires a speedy evangelization of the world</h3>
						<p>GP mobilizes more workers in Korea, the United States, and the mission field to share the gospel.
