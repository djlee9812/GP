				<p>The ultimate purpose of our lives and ministry is "to give glory to God". GP will lose its purpose of existence from the moment we stop glorifying God. We declare to be in pursuit of mission that is ruled and overwhelmed by the glory of God in all aspects of our lives until the returning of our Lord in glory.
				</p>
				<p>GP USA achieves this purpose by training and sending missionaries all around the world. We cooperate and support our missionaries through supporter donations. We also host many events in our Anaheim office and work with several churches.</p>

				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1968, Dr. David Cho started the first indigenous mission organization in Korea and named it Korea International Mission, an event that should be noted as a historical moment. It was an organization that trained Korean missionaries and sent them to harvest fields around the world. KIM grew steadily and solely took the responsibility to awake, mobilize, and train Korean mission personnel when the Korean church was still in its infant stage. <br/><br/>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, KIM spearheaded the formation of Asia Missions Association and the Third World Missions Association to bring unity and partnership among the non-Western mission forces and to balance out unilateral Western-led mission movement. Decades after the inauguration of KIM, many KIM missionaries from Thailand took a different direction and separated to name themselves Korean Global Mission in 1987. Then, in 1992, many remaining missionaries also detached from KIM and established Partners for World Mission. However, both mission agencies were the offspring of KIM and the separation was part of its painful process of growth. <br/><br/>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before encountering the third millennium, on May 25th, 1999, Korean Global Mission and Partners for World Mission were merged into one and opened a new horizon in Korean mission history. Since GP started in 1999, GP has sent 279 missionaries to 31 countries and worked for world mission.
