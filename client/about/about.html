				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1968, Dr. David Cho started the first indigenous mission organization in Korea and named it Korea International Mission, an event that should be noted as a historical moment. It was an organization that trained Korean missionaries and sent them to harvest fields around the world. KIM grew steadily and solely took the responsibility to awake, mobilize, and train Korean mission personnel when the Korean church was still in its infant stage. <br/><br/>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, KIM spearheaded the formation of Asia Missions Association and the Third World Missions Association to bring unity and partnership among the non-Western mission forces and to balance out unilateral Western-led mission movement. Decades after the inauguration of KIM, many KIM missionaries from Thailand took a different direction and separated to name themselves Korean Global Mission in 1987. Then, in 1992, many remaining missionaries also detached from KIM and established Partners for World Mission. However, both mission agencies were the offspring of KIM and the separation was part of its painful process of growth. <br/><br/>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before encountering the third millennium, on May 25th, 1999, Korean Global Mission and Partners for World Mission were merged into one and opened a new horizon in Korean mission history. Since GP started in 1999, GP has sent 279 missionaries to 31 countries and worked for world mission.

				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Church-Centered</h3>
						<p>
							Missions are a commandment given to the church. Therefore, a church without mission or mission without church-planting is being disobedient to the Lord. We declare to serve the church and to minister around the church and our effort and strategy is to establish the biblical and indigenous church.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Cooperation and Network</h3>
						<p>
							We believe all churches in the world are one body in Christ. We declare to mend partnership among the churches and mission agencies, not in competition with, but in the spirit of cooperation in order to build the Kingdom of God together.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Sharing Community</h3>
						<p>
							We declare to follow the model of the global church in their sharing spirit. We will bear each otherâ€™s burden by sharing what we have, even our financial resources.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Servant Spirit</h3>
						<p>
							We are the followers of Christ, who washed the feet of his disciples. We believe that this humble spirit is essential to save others in the mission field. We declare to live an incarnation life of servant hood shown by our Lord.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Developing Local Leadership</h3>
						<p>
							Our philosophy of ministry is to develop local leaders, so that eventually leadership should be handed over to them to continue. We declare to work together with the locals, from the pioneering stage, to set up biblical indigenous church and someday, relinquish our leadership. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Giving Ultimate Glory to God</h3>
						<p>
							The ultimate purpose of our life and work is to give glory to God. We lose our purpose of existence the moment we stop glorifying God. We declare to be ruled and overwhelmed by God in all aspects of our lives until the returning of our Lord in glory
